# caesar_cipher
Context : 

Vesper would like to go on vacation with James Bond and decide to send him a message. Spectre is still a danger and she fears that the message could be intercepted. For that reason, she compiles a program called 'caesar_cipher.py' using the pyton language in order to encrypt her message. 

On the  over hand, James Bond just came back from his poker game in Montenegro(see 'Casino Royal') and received a message from his sweetie Vesper. He realizes that the message is encrypted using the caesar cypher algorithm. James has a copy of the program compiled by Vesper and run the code to decrypt it.


Note : The caesar cipher is a encryption algorithm that was used By Caesar :

- the algo shifs letters by a certain number of place in the alphabet.
- the key is the length of the shift

            ex: for a key of value 3, (B will become E)
